    It is January 16th, 2023, and you're watching The Code Report. Tailwind is
    the worst way to do CSS, except for all the other ways that have been tried.
    An epic war erupted yesterday after somebody had the audacity to post a
    Tailwind snippet on Twitter. The Allied Tailwind Alliance defended this
    code, while the Unified CSS Fundamentalists said horrible dehumanizing
    things about it like it's not even real CSS. As a result, many insecure
    nerds suffered slightly hurt feelings from hearing mild criticisms about
    technology choices that their clients will never care about. It was truly
    horrific. I decided to run a poll to see where you guys fall, and although
    most have never tried it, four out of five people that have tried Tailwind
    love it. Still though, it has its trade-offs and may not be a good fit for
    every project. In this video, I want to explain the problems Tailwind solves
    because it's obvious that many people don't even understand them, yet still
    have no problem hating on a free and open source tool publicly. I personally
    joined the Tailwind cult a couple years ago, after refusing to drink the
    Kool-Aid for quite a while. In my experience, it's a tool like TypeScript or
    Svelte that makes it really hard to go back to the thing you were using
    before, because it saves a ton of time. And becoming a productive developer
    is all about using your time wisely. The first problem with CSS is
    co-location. The standard practice for the last 20 years has been to
    separate your CSS from the markup to provide a good separation of concerns,
    and doing otherwise means you go to hell. As programmers, we know the
    hardest part of the job is naming things, and this practice requires you to
    come up with a lot of arbitrary names that are often pointless. A few weeks
    later when you come back to modify this code, it becomes difficult to figure
    out which styles actually apply to each element, because you've totally
    forgotten what these class names do. And you might have used these class
    names in multiple places, so if you try to change it, it could break
    unexpected parts of the UI. Tailwind addresses this problem by giving you
    standard utility classes that are co-located in the HTML. This results in
    disgusting, bloated HTML that looks like blasphemous inline styles at first
    glance. And that's a very valid criticism, and likely the main turn-off for
    people when they first look into using Tailwind. However, the benefit is
    that you don't have all these arbitrary class names anymore, and know
    exactly which styles apply to it. And that just clears a ton of mental
    overhead from your plate. You can make modifications safely without breaking
    other parts of the app. Also, here's a little pro tip. If you're using
    Tailwind and hate the way your HTML looks, the inline fold vs code extension
    can automatically minimize it for you. Problem number two is that CSS is
    verbose. Remember everything in Tailwind is just CSS. Hover over any class
    to view the actual CSS code. What's cool about it though is that it uses
    clever naming conventions like inset zero to do something in one line of
    code that would take six lines of CSS, because it combines properties and
    values together. I would estimate that tailwind results in approximately
    one-third the total amount of code that you would have with vanilla CSS, and
    the best type of code is the code you never have to write. However, a valid
    criticism of this approach is that you have to learn an abstraction on top
    of CSS, which is not ideal. It's always best to use the platform natively,
    but the web platform is often cruel and vengeful. Now, problem three is that
    CSS gives you too much control over the UI, while frameworks like Bootstrap
    are too difficult to customize. Tailwind falls right in the middle of these,
    giving you a standard set of constraints to make sure the UI looks good, but
    tends to be much easier to customize to accommodate any design. Like when
    you build a Bootstrap app, it always tends to look like a bootstrap app.
    With Tailwind, it's not so obvious. Now the final problem I want to talk
    about is zombie styles. We have a tendency to write styles that never
    actually get used, and just bloat the CSS bundle. Tailwind will
    automatically purge all unused styles to kill the zombies and remove this
    dead code. That's pretty cool, but the drawback is that Tailwind is a pretty
    heavy-handed approach. It takes like five steps to set up to install the
    Tailwind CLI, PostCSS, and the VS Code extension. For that reason, I only
    use it on big projects. For smaller demos, I've been using PicoCSS, which
    can make things look good with zero effort thanks to its classless approach.
    As you can see, there are many pros and cons to a library like Tailwind.
    Ultimately, here's a good rule you can go by. If you like Tailwind, use it.
    If you don't like Tailwind, don't use it. Nobody cares. Literally nobody
    cares about your technology choices except you. This has been The Code
    Report. Thanks for watching, and I will see you in the next one.
